# Browser Extensions Usage

Once installed, you can start using the Email Alias Extension.

## 1. Configure Settings

1.  Open the extension's **Options** page. You can usually do this by right-clicking the extension icon in your browser's toolbar and selecting "Options" or "Manage Extension" and then "Extension options".
2.  Enter your domain (e.g., `example.com`). This should be the same domain you configured for your Cloudflare Worker.
3.  Click **"Generate New Key"** to create a cryptographically secure secret key.
4.  **CRITICAL:** Use the provided buttons to copy the generated key and **immediately save it to a secure password manager** (like Bitwarden or 1Password). This key is essential for your worker to validate aliases generated by this extension.
5.  Check the box confirming you have backed up the key.
6.  Click **Save**.

## 2. Deploy to Cloudflare

After generating and saving your key, you need to add it to your Cloudflare Worker's configuration.

-   Add the generated key as a new secret variable to your Cloudflare Worker's `EMAIL_SECRET_MAPPING` (e.g., if your key is `mysecretkey123`, you might add `"mysecretkey123": "your-real-email@gmail.com"` to your mapping).
-   Deploy or update your Cloudflare Worker with this new secret.

For detailed instructions on configuring and deploying your Cloudflare Worker, refer to the [Cloudflare Worker Setup Guide](../cloudflare-worker/index.md).

## 3. Generate Aliases

Once the extension is configured and your worker is deployed, you can start generating aliases.

-   **From the Extension Popup:**
    1.  Click the extension icon in your browser's toolbar.
    2.  Enter a `label` (e.g., `shopping`) and an optional `source` (e.g., `amazon.com`).
    3.  Click **Generate** and copy the alias.
    4.  Success notifications will confirm when aliases are generated and copied.

-   **Using the Context Menu:**
    -   Right-click on any webpage.
    -   Select the option provided by the extension (e.g., "Generate Alias for Current Domain") to quickly generate an alias based on the current website's domain.

-   **Keyboard Shortcuts:**
    -   **Open Popup**: `Ctrl+Shift+U` (or `Cmd+Shift+U` on macOS) - Opens the alias generator popup.
    -   **Fill Current Field**: `Ctrl+Shift+E` (or `Cmd+Shift+E` on macOS) - Generates an alias and attempts to fill an email input field on the current page.

## Enhanced Features

-   **Toast Notifications**: Get real-time feedback for successful operations and errors.
-   **Auto-fill Detection**: The extension detects email fields and can auto-fill them.
-   **Dark Mode**: Automatically adapts to your browser's theme preference.
