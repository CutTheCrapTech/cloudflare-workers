# Cloudflare Worker Setup Guide

For the project's GitHub repository, visit [cloudflare-worker](https://github.com/CutTheCrapTech/email-gateway-cloudflare/tree/main/packages/cloudflare-worker) repo.

This guide will walk you through setting up the Cloudflare Worker for secure email forwarding. This worker integrates [`email-alias-core`](https://github.com/CutTheCrapTech/email-gateway-cloudflare/tree/main/packages/email-alias-core) to form a private email gateway on Cloudflare.

## Features

- **Secure Email Forwarding:** Uses HMAC-based email aliases to verify incoming emails, preventing unauthorized use of your email domain.
- **Email Alias Generation:** Email aliases are generated by companion browser extensions, ensuring seamless integration and ease of use.
- **Cloudflare Native:** Built to run entirely on the Cloudflare serverless platform.
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Designed to be deployed via Terraform.

## Architecture

The Cloudflare Worker is the core of the email gateway. It's responsible for:

- Receiving all emails sent to your domain.
- Validating the recipient alias using `email-alias-core`.
- Forwarding the validated email to your real inbox.

Let's get started with the setup!
