# Cloudflare Worker Deployment: Terraform

If you are using the `homelab` repository, it provides a complete infrastructure setup that includes:

-   Cloudflare Workers deployment
-   Email routing configuration
-   DNS setup
-   Environment and secret management

This approach is ideal for production deployments and teams managing multiple environments. Refer to the [homelab repository](https://github.com/CutTheCrapTech/homelab/tree/main/tofu/cloudflare/email-alias/) for detailed instructions.
